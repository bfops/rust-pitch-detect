[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bfops/rust-pitch-detect.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bfops/rust-pitch-detect)

Building pitch detection in Rust. The results are really wrong, but they seem to shift properly with pitch changes.

Dependencies:

  * Nightly rust and cargo
  * [portaudio](http://www.portaudio.com/)
  * [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
